Adewole is a second-year university student who loves sharing study wins and photos of campus life on social media. One week before finals she receives a friendly message from an account that claims to be from the university IT desk. The message says there’s a problem with her student account and asks her to “confirm” some details so her access isn’t locked. The tone is urgent but polite, and the message includes a link to “resolve the issue quickly.”
